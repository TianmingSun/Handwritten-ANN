# Handwritten Artifical Neural Network
* Handwritten implementation of multi-layer Artifical Neural Network in Python3.  
* No gradiant grid search added, purly handwritten neural network, using only numpy.  
> Have fun :)

#
* Demonstration is edited in the jupyter notebook file ANN.ipynb.  
* If you would like to ues any of the functions used in the demonstration, refer to the python file ANN.py.
